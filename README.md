# War-Swift

Enjoy playing my new card game app written in Swift. The goal of the game is to reach 26 points before the enemy. If the card 
from your deck has a higher rank than your enemy's one, you will receive a point. In case of a tie, no one receives a point.
Otherwise, the enemy scores. Once either one reaches 26 points, the game starts over. 

Have fun!
